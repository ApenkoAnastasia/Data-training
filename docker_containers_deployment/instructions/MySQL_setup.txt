In bash start mysql server:

	service mysql stop
	usermod -d /var/lib/mysql/ mysql
	service mysql start

Check it's status (must be '+'):

	service --status-all
	#service mysql status

Run the security script:

	mysql_secure_installation

If you decide to use the password validation plugin, the script will prompt you to select the password validation level.
Next, accept all the conditions ('y'), set your password.

Run MySQL and change your plugin for root ('password' - change for your pass.):
	mysql
	SELECT user,authentication_string,plugin,host FROM mysql.user;
	ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'password';
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Check your plugin for root (it could be caching_sha2_password):
	SELECT user,authentication_string,plugin,host FROM mysql.user;
	exit

Now you can now log in with your password with this command:
	mysql -u root -p
